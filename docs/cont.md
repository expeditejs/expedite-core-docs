## Guidelines

### General guidelines

- The master branch is where incoming new features are merged (the next coming release).
- All new features / bugs should be done in dedicated branch from the `master` branch.
- It's a very nice thing to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. It's easier to review it. Then we will squash it before merging.

### Commit messages

This project does not use any fixed commit convention. But please state purpose of your commit briefly explaining the update. You can also add a description if it's needed. That's all ;)

### Adding new feature

Ideally you should open a suggestion issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/expeditejs/expedite).

Practically, you should rant about it on [devRant](https://devrant.com/) as well as [Twitter](https://twitter.com) as well [Instagram](https://instagram.com) and tag Alok(@TheWhiteWulfy) everywhere(user id is same everywhere except on github), and probably link to this repo. The constant buzz of notifications may bring it to Alok's notice, and you can expect a faster reply and feature addition. If he still doesn't reply, head over to [his site](https://alokprateek.in) and spam his every communication method and social network you see for even faster resolution.
